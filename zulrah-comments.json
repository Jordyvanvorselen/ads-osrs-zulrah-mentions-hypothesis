But the margins (profit you will obtain from flipping) are very low due to how easily it is to flip and it can go down a price if people suddenly dump their inventories into the GE.\n\nBig item flipping comes with watching the price fluctuation and understanding when is a good time to sell vs holding onto the item. Take the Zulrah nerf, its been constantly brought up in Q\u0026As and many Jmods agree to it. Those who look ahead were ready to sell their Zulrah gear and make profit from the eventual nerf.\n\nThen there is also word of mouth where people watch streams and the Q\u0026A for hints as to what would be the \"hot item\" to flip. An example was when the Q\u0026A talked about buffing the BGS to a 50% spec and people quickly bought BGS and resold for higher price.\n\nOtherwise, its just down to timing, luck and experience."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297c92b8"},"author":"Triplexxx501","created":1.496973451e+09,"message":"Insert poll booth next to zulrah "},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297c9400"},"author":"donkeykong1212","created":1.496985173e+09,"message":"Nerf the gays! buff void \u0026 zulrah"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297c9740"},"author":"obfuscatiion","created":1.496947128e+09,"message":"Not really, they can't poll stuff like the zulrah nerf of the void nerf because most people don't know what is best for the integrity of the game"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297c9831"},"author":"Ruztik","created":1.496950242e+09,"message":"I can't learn new things on this game when I'm high.

Most people probably don't even care whether or not a Pride event is added, but because it was added without consent, it's suddenly unwanted.\n\nPersonally, if this was polled it probably would've passed, but Jagex decided to not poll it because it was a small event, it got shit all over on Reddit and now it's *become* political even though it didn't start out that way.\n\n\n"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297cb553"},"author":"Kurai1337","created":1.496874493e+09,"message":"liiiiitle late to the crying about people crying about the nerfs they did on zulrah nerf day party"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297cb6ad"},"author":"Ruztik","created":1.496875146e+09,"message":"You're right, because I didn't even have a Reddit account then lol.\n\nMy first concern was with the Zulrah nerf.

I agree that zulrah, and void needed a nerf. But the way they went about it was pretty dumb. Void was only op In PvP (don't know this from experience, but I've heard it was). It was not op in PvM though, and I know this from experience. By polling the void nerf I think there should have been a nerf regardless, but they should have polled the different options.\n\nThey literally nerfed void from the best PvM gear in a decent amount of plAces to being worse then black d hide at all places.\n\nThey could have done so many different/cool things, like\n\n1. A straight nerf to 15% damage.\n\nThis would make it comparable to arma (at the old spots void was best at). So arma would be best at sara, arma, and just as good as void in raids, zulrah. Etc. This would have given an expensive option (arma , which would be bIS everywhere now), but you could still get void in about 15 hours for a good alternative. Then they could nerf further if they had to.\n\n2. They could have simply nerfed the armor in PvP (like the blowpipe) alone, and/or increased the repair cost of void, and make it drop more money. \n\n3. They could have nerfed void to 10% damage (which they did), but lock an increase to damage behind western diaries.\n\nNormal void would be 10% accuracy/damage when you get from pest controls. This would make it doll shit, and always worse theN Black d hide.\n\nMedium diary would put it to 10%\\12.5% accuracy\\damage. This is easily obtainable, and would make the armor better then black d hide, but worse then arma by far.\n\nHard diaries would give you elite void (+6 prayer bonus), and increase the damage portion to 15%. Back to option one, this would make it comparable to arma, but it would take like 30-40 hours to obtain to this point (15hrs for normal void, and 15-25hrs to complete hard diaries, assuming you don't just have the skills). With this it still Wouldn't be better then arma.\n\nYou could put the damage % to 17.5% with the elite diaries, but you could also just leave it st the hard.\n\nI like option 3 the most as it adds some cool interactions. They also could combine any one of these options. Anything was better then what they did.\n\nBut ya I see no problem with the event. I won't participate, but I'm so indifferent it's funny.\n\nI do however think they should not make the event matter for anything else (completionist cape, or music cape, etc). \n\nI don't really get what the big fuss is"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d18fb"},"author":"OSRS_HELL","created":1.496710444e+09,"message":"Nerf autism ban zulrah"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d1995"},"author":"Mizu-Neko","created":1.496709444e+09,"message":"Zulrah is still good."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d1996"},"author":"Sohail316","created":1.496709474e+09,"message":"its still good, even if it got nerfed you legit still make a good amount of money, if you still don't wanna do it even though its been proven its still great, Demonic gorillas though the zenyte jewellery is dropping  hard right now.

Obviously, merching and flipping deserves a mention, but it's not guaranteed money, nor  is your starting capital enough to work with.\n\nSo, combat it is. Get your combat up to 85 and start doing slayer tasks from Nieve. Waste of time to do slayer before that. Many methods to get to 85, such as NMZ or sand crabs.\nGet your combat as high as possible through slayer and NMZ.

If new or replaced audio tracks were something you'd be interested in pursuing, would you work with him to have them added?\n\n4. Based off pure speculation right now, what do you think Jagex will do (if anything) about your client? If the client continues to be a \"ban risk,\" would you ever make it downloadable again, with an attached warning?\n\n5. How secure/safe is the client?

These models can sometimes take hours to do – all the different types (Zulrah has 6 models etc). Zulrah took 12 hours alone. We had to texture all of the individual triangles for every model. The texturing tool is one of the many tools we wrote for this huge project, here you can see how many triangles there are in this single Zulrah model: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/xZll2\n\n\n\nThis reason it takes so long is because we couldn’t use texture maps, we had to manually texture every single triangle. \nWe also had to make our own tools to texture these models, which took a long time.\n\n\nThe water alone also took several weeks to make. We had to generate depth because the regular client lacks it, and we customized it according to the area (e.g during the waterfall quest it flows much quicker).\n\n\nWe also made our own LD rendering engine completely from scratch that supports multi-threading – this took a few weeks as well.\nThese are just a few examples of the technological challenges that we faced with making this client."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4dc1"},"author":"LiquidFangay","created":1.496617995e+09,"message":"I thought it was interesting that they singled out Zulrah specifically taking 12 hours, probably because it was one of the few models they actually textured themselves"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4e3d"},"author":"DMunE","created":1.496639481e+09,"message":"And I still can't even fucking kill Zulrah lol"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4e42"},"author":"Jomvae","created":1.496604384e+09,"message":"Zulrah is so hot I want to nut in her"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4e43"},"author":"celery_under","created":1.496611049e+09,"message":"Zulrah was confirmed male on release, then later changed to be undetermined."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4e44"},"author":"TzTok-Adam","created":1.496671099e+09,"message":"Wiki says NPC's refer to Zulrah as both a \"he\" and a \"she\" *"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4e49"},"author":"MoustacheMauve","created":1.496616411e+09,"message":"Zulrah is trans confirmed\n\nnext update:\n\n\u003egave zulrah a boob job\n\n\u003egave zulrah wig"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d4e4e"},"author":"Cakesmite","created":1.496610039e+09,"message":"**ZULRAH IS SO HOT I WANT TO TO NUT IN HER**"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297d50bf"},"author":"leovonnewton","created":1.496594846e+09,"message":"Bossing or slay up to abyssals.

This is the comment that I needed! Well, firstly to answer most of your questions, it's a 100+ clan. Now, the reason for that is mostly due to the fact that the other 3 co-founders were between 100-110, myself being higher. I wanted to do a 120+ or perhaps even 115, but unfortunately we can't have a clan with requirements that leaders don't.\n\nThe total level requirements were something that I didn't exactly fully agree on, however it DOES (sort of) weed out the NMZ prods (which, surprisingly, we get a lot of) \u0026 other general Runescape players (since the clan has SEMI-social aspects)). I personally don't agree with the requirements fully; personally wanted gear reqs \u0026 splits to be a part of promotions, however, having lower levelled leaders made that quite difficult, and these were the people I definitely wanted to start a clan with. \n\n\nThe Agility requirement was just a thought, seeing as though it IS a fairly standard requirement to a boss. I sort of expect everyone to be ready to walk into any boss right away. Now, I am MORE than happy to teach people bosses that they may not have done before (or for a long time), however I sort of expect that they can gear up, walk straight into the boss room/area \u0026 start learning.\n\nI just think that we're getting lots of \"im lvl 98 but can i join? I have 3 KC on Zulrah \u0026 i tried callisto once\". I REALLY don't want to be elitest myself, but I expect more than someone that has NEVER bossed in their life \u0026 has no gear reqs or the actual boss reqs themselves.\n\nThe ONLY bossing requirements in the game are for GWD bosses (excluding solo-only bosses); 70 HP, Agility, Ranged \u0026 Strength. Everything else can be done as minimal as you want (Raids are a bit more subjective, however.\n\nI guess I'm trying to slowly bump things up now that everyone in the clan is growing \u0026 wanting to reach the requirements that I'd like to put forward (which I love). We did also lose two co-founders due to personal reasons, so it's just down to me \u0026 another leader Bolwerk. \n\nI agree with you in the sense that Agility shouldn't be a REQUIREMENT, per sae, however since we're getting fairly low-mid levelled players, a lot of them don't have Sara requirements (and I love Sara and want more people to go with :p).\n\nYour constructive argument was EXACTLY what I was looking for \u0026 I guess I really should've explained the situation a little more clearly.\n\nAppreciate it mate :)\n\n"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dbbb2"},"author":"smess_osrs","created":1.496214211e+09,"message":"20 yew bots make less money than nerfed zulrah"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dbbb5"},"author":"MinisterRage","created":1.496218702e+09,"message":"but requires no effort to set up compared to a Zulrah account."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dbc12"},"author":"Omfinite","created":1.496211427e+09,"message":"\u003ewe can expect to see anywhere from a 2-6% rebound for these two\n\nDeaths are easily gonna reach 280 ea again, if not 300+.

I took all of your suggestions to heart and I've been grinding away for the past week to try to learn Javascript and turn my previously shown loot logger program into a web app. If you never saw my first thread, you can look at it here https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6cnnzo/need_feedback_for_a_loot_logging_program_i_wrote/ . \n\nI got a ton of feedback, and while there were a lot of great suggestions that I'll continue to work on, the biggest was that people weren't comfortable with having to download an (.exe) from a stranger. That's completely understandable, so I did my best to convert my program, previously made in python using tkinter, into a webapp that could run in anyones browser, no download required. I am happy to say that it's nearly done. The GIF shows everything that it can do now, but I know it's fast so I'll recount the features below. \n\n- All selected monster loot shows as image/buttons that when clicked, log their respective loot name to the log on the left. \n- If an item can drop in various quantities, instead of logging, a new screen opens presenting the user with the quantities to choose from. \n- Herbs are hard to distinguish from just their image (they're all green and dirty) so the herb button opens a text-button menu. \n- Also, since certain NPC's can drop multiple different herbs in the same kill, the herb menu buttons add your selections to a log on the right. Clicking add logs them all under the same kill # to the main log. \n- There is an undo button in case you add something you didn't want to. This removes an entire kill, so if you add 5 herbs to one loot, clicking undo once will remove that whole kill. \n- The Rare drop table button is visible for all NPC's, even if they can't access it. I can probably make it go away unless the NPC can actually access the rare drop table, but for now it didn't seem important or too intrusive. \n- There will be a seed button as well which acts just like the herb button, just haven't gotten around to doing it because I know it will be easy. \n- I'm having a really hard time making a save button to save the data in the log to a csv or something. Currently, the save button just highlights the entire log. If you want the data in excel, click save and then copy it all, paste it in excel. It will be in one column, but if you select the column and use \"text to columns\" delimiting on \".\" and \":\" you'll have the data in 3 columns.\n- I will continue to try to get a real save button working, the main problem isn't the saving but being able to name the file, which javascript doesn't seem to support.   \n\nI know the colors are whack, I'm currently using the colors to see how the layout is set up easier so I can position new elements quickly. I do need help with the design though, if you have a mock up of what would look better, let me know. I'm not good at that sort of thing so I'll take any suggestions seriously.   \n\nI set it up so that adding new monsters is pretty easy, so I'm thinking I can have 10-15 to choose from right off the bat when I release it. Which monsters should this be?\nKeep in mind, I know bosses are wanted and I plan on adding them, but it's a bit harder because they have unique drop mechanics that will have to have a custom made page. I believe Zulrah will be the first boss unless you guys think another one is more in demand?  \n\nI hope you guys like what I've done so far. Let me know what you think, good or bad, I'm open to critique.

I will be adding more monsters as soon as I can. \n\nBosses are a bit trickier, but I am going to add them for sure as soon as I can. By this upcoming weekend I plan to have at least Zulrah in place. I have to customize each bosses page because they all have unique loot mechanics and don't really fit the \"mould\" that I made for most normal monsters. \n\nI will do my best to get everyones suggestions implemented.

Maybe adjust the rate at which they restock, but removing the shop would cause the bots to switch to fishing them, something not competitive and not gated by restock time. \n\nIn terms of boss drops we HAVE to have some resources on boss tables.

It isn't wrong or a mistake for a boss to profit differently than others, but Zulrah is a bit too generous by offering 100%, common, and rare profits. Still, saying you should lose money without uniques is just silly because plenty of bosses don't work like this.\n\nAs for coin sinks, we have several and more are added when needed and fitting. Skilling isn't pointless and while some skilling profits are down, skilling is still fairly profitable.

Some methods are a bit down at the moment, but that doesn't make it bad. Even at their low point, Astrals are still 800K per hour and there are plenty of other runes with Cosmics, Deaths, 2x Natures, and 2x Deaths. Aside from Runecrafting, both Mining and Smithing can make fairly good amounts of profit per hour at high levels with Blast Furnace and Blast Mining. Hunter can make a lot of money too. Non-combat Magic also has a ton of ways to profit. Do these methods give as good as profit as Bosses? Usually not, but bosses tend to require more investment and effort than skills too.\n\nWe do have Coin Sinks. Construction is a Coin Sink. LMS is a Coin Sink. NMZ is a Coin Sink. One-off upgrades like Edgeville Respawn is a Coin Sink. PvP Untradeables is a Coin Sink. Barrows Armor is a Coin Sink... Saying that none exist is just ignorant. Furthermore, last we heard from the OSRS Team, the game didn't really need more coin sinks and coins was going out about as quick as it is coming in. Also, we recently saw the Karamja shop nerf, which means less coins coming in. Death and item sinks are a different conversation.\n\nDifferent style of bosses profit differently; there is nothing wrong with that. For example, at Mole, most your profit comes from its 100% hides and it doesn't have a rare drop. KBD is a bit of a mix, but most of the profit is from the 100% and the rare drops. DKs is mostly from the 100% bones and the rare drops... KQ is mostly from the common loot and rare drops; same for Wildy Bosses. Just because you prefer the profit being primarily from the rare drops doesn't mean that system is better and Zulrah is certainly not the only one that profit differently.\n\nAs for Skilling Resources, they have always come from PvM as well as skilling. Some like Runes, Herbs, and Seeds were from PvM before they were even skilling resources... It is not a problem when Bosses or such drop skilling resources; it is a problem when they provide more of the supply than the skills they originated from. There are still some cases where this is an issue, but the recent Zulrah nerf has greatly helped with this and perhaps in the future other problem resources will be addressed too.\n"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297df960"},"author":"IVIorphinz","created":1.495893075e+09,"message":"Still looks common to me.

A few are consistent as well, such as Mole and DKs with their respective diaries, but for the most part a lot of PvM still depends on uniques to reach higher profit/h, while Zulrah didn't.

Iirc this phenomenon always caused ely to spike during those weeks, and buckler will replace ely in that situation because no one ever died in those cups; it was simply a race to see who could get more kills. It's also very cheap so its panic buy could be much more impacting than ely's which in hindsight was really just keeping it from crashing. That would be the item to put all your money into and leave in the ge for double if you're going away for the summer. \n\nElder maul I was never really impressed by it. The crush market is saturated and is reflective of the fact that they can't release new weapons past t75. I always saw this one as the bandos boots of the 3 weapons...perhaps the spectral of the 3 would be a better analogy. It has the most potential to crash out of any of the raids items because it has very little use. It's currently being propped up by testers  and it needs to crash hard so that it can get hoarded and the hoarders then begin to field ideas to buff it. \n\nAncestral set is probably the one that you're most interest in. The hat needs to be avoided at all costs as there is a guy with 50 of them that he bought in the mid 40s thinking he could force zulrah killers to overpay. Accordingly, this item is prime for a super lowball where you leave in a buy limit offer at like 21m. The rest of the set I believe will stagnate at its current price. Perhaps go up a little bit as the panic dies down, but then crash a little bit again as the deflationary impact takes its toll on the entire market. The outlook ancestral is weak in general as there is very little mage content coming out this year--if blood barraging inferno isn't the meta there won't be any at all. There is also the potential for a void mage buff weighing against it. Nevertheless, you shouldn't underestimate the current meta of barraging slayer tasks and gwd minions which will probably prevent if from crashing and stabilizing at something far lower than current. \n\nFinally, twisted bow has a good short term outlook, but a bad longterm one. It too will be a must have for the pvm cup and my theory for inferno is that the fight cave's ketzeks (360s) will be replaced with 33 jads--essentially making twisted bow a must have for inferno. However, both of these will have only a temporary impact on price. The big thing to look at if planning to bet against the it is what drop rate the pet will have. I don't expect them to give it a time consuming drop rate. That will leave it with a lot of uncertainty since it will be worth too many coins in a deflating economy where less people are doing less-profitable zulrah kills and more people are hunting the bow itself. Its high drop rate is also extremely alarming as it suggests that its high price is being maintained by its sheer usefulness as a must-have for sara/prime/raids. Sara/prime are huge sources of longterm demand as the pets are tier-2 5ks, but they're also some of the more common pets out there. Accordingly it will probably be the best daily flip of all the raids items. The risk here will be it dropping 150 or 300m and then staying within 20m of that for 6 months. \n\n"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dfe5b"},"author":"oneluckytito","created":1.495870062e+09,"message":"Zulrah is still viable"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dfe63"},"author":"Tuhajuhan","created":1.495868217e+09,"message":"Zulrah kc?"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dfe68"},"author":"Samuri_Kni","created":1.495855679e+09,"message":"Pick flax now that zulrah is nerfed"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaef5b73bcf297dfe79"},"author":"RNGreed","created":1.495854182e+09,"message":"They're looking to address interactive and plentiful food gathering methods.

Zulrah may be predictable, but it is still more challenging and attentive than Pest Control, which is semi-AFK. Pretty much you are comparing a semi-AFK training Minigame that pays you for winning to grinding high-level bosses for profit, which are pretty different past the \"they both take time\" part...

I do think Void should be useful, but I don't think it should be the best all-around armor. I mean Void is the best Damage boost and Prayer so I think it is okay if the accuracy armors surpass it against higher defence foes like Zulrah; the question is where is that threshold and how much is Void still viable for.

I've said this so many times now, but I think they should have found a different way to nerf void. For instance,\n\n- why didn't they just nerf it in PvP and leave it alone in PvM. It wasn't busted in PvM. Sure, it was good, but it was not bIS at every boss (I.e. Arma st Sara and armadyl, or melee st bandos or zammy). \n\n- why didn't they test out a nerf to 15% damage instead of 10%\n\n- why didn't they nerf till 10%, then lock progression damage increase through western diaries?  For instance,\n\nNormal void would be at 10% accuracy/10% damage, and would be basically always be worse than black d hide, but take 10-20 hours to get. They could even increase the amount of points gained in pest control to lower this if they wanted \n\nMedium diaries would be at 10% accuracy/12.5% damage. This would make it better then black d hide when you have high range, and enemy has lowish range defence, and is easily obtainable due to the diary being medium.\n\nHard diaries would be at 10% accuracy/15% damage/+6  prayer bonus because of it becoming elite void. This would make it comparable to arma, but arma would for sure be better at sara, and armadyl. Arma would probably still be better everywhere.\n\nNow you could stop here, and that would be fine, but,\n\nElite diary could buff elite void to 17.5% damage/10% accuracy. This would probably make it better then arma at those bosses that I didn't list (zulrah, raids, etc), but would be down from where it started, and would require you to have insane stats to get the elite bonus .\n\nThey could also nerf void in PvP, to make it different from PvM like they did with the blow pipe.\n\nThey did the same thing with the serpentine helm, they just nerfed the shit out of it, but they also destroyed part of the identity that it was. There is no need to go to such extreme nerfs to begin with.

Let's assume Jagex was correct, and the average loot is now 30% less, so say 80k per kill now.

Only viable gwd for void is attacking at bandos and that assumes rigour, it's used at raids because of the versatility of it and dps mattering so much, zulrah only for the range bonus but that's due to the Mage set being so useless due to how Mage bonuses are spread on armour not put on the weapon, I can't think of any other places it is used as much. Two sets as in the main three and different helms, plus elite if you can get it. \n\nI don't deny that the people who can spend their time on the game should have access to better stuff, but that outlook also punishes those who can't spend the time. There's reasons that bandos/arma etc have such high price points, tbow is another example, those who can spend the time getting the money for the rare drops have much more use for it, add in the rarity of the drops and they stay high.\n\nThe main loss with void is that it is a great balancer, while it isn't best in slot for most things, it at least gives people versatile gear that at least allows them to be competitive. They aren't the people who can min/max things and those who can and do min/max things are the ones that can spend the money. For example tekton, not everyone has the money to spend on an elder maul for the one boss and so are left with a viable alternative in the hasta, it allows those who have the time to spend the option of min/maxing but still allows people who don't the opportunity to be competitive and have a shot. Void is the same, while it may not be best in slot it at least gives people the flexibility in getting something that isn't locked behind a pay wall which then allows them greater opportunities. \n\nI'm not talking about entitlement either. What I am saying is game balance for all communities. Void was a great alternative for the more casual community that allowed them access to raids while being competitive, without leaving them stuck unable to find any teams because they're not running around in max gear. Hell for raids it's hard enough getting a team without 150m+ of gear (acb/tbuckler/dwh etc). \n\nYes, I get that AFKing has opened up a lot of the game for people, but I would say a lot less than you'd think. I think that osrs has an older population now and as such they need to be able to cater to a population who have jobs/families/responsibilities which reduce their time to play. \nAnd yes, I get that some people can AFK at work, but that's not everyone. \n\nI guess the main core of what I am saying is that while top tier items, ie t bow, are reasonably out of reach for a more casual population, osrs also has to cater to a population who can't spend that much time on the game. If they can't commit to making the game accessible and enjoyable to casual players then they will end up losing those players and I'd even say that a lot of them would be paying cash directly into the game in the form of memberships and even selling bonds for gp. If they balance and cater in favour of the players who can and do spend a significant amount of time they will kill the game. \n\nIt's not unreasonable for a player to spend 10-15 hours over the course of a week grinding zulrah so that they can then spend 4-5 hours on their day off slaying with the new shiny tassets they got over the course of a week, but removing opportunities like that because some kid who is failing themselves out of college or someone collecting disability while living at home spent that 10-15 hours each day for a week straight made too much gp is unreasonable imo.

I wonder if the fact they're finally nerfing Zulrah is evidence they're now better able to analyse the data they're collecting, which may mean there are better and more speedy balance changes occurring in the future.

Another great example is brews to crushed nests. You will still need the Herblore level for brews, which is no small feat on an ironman, before you can really use that drop. It is also worth quite a bit, so getting it on a non-ironman is still good. \n\nAlso, for an easy skill as cooking, I think it a great idea that they removed the raw resource sharks, with an already cooked one. The manta ray drop is worth about 50k atm, so it's still a good thing to get on non-ironmen too. \n\nHowever, replacing 100 magic logs with 35 yew logs, and 10 runite ore with 2 runite ore (these are the most significant ones), I don't understand. The price of runite ore will NOT go up. Smithing resources are mainly determined by the value of the finished project, and since the value of the finished product will go down with the removal of the karamja shop exploit (everyone will just alch/sell on g.e. now), I predict that after a short rise now, it will go down even further in price than pre-nerf zulrah. In regard to the magic logs, I find that it makes no sense that a wyvern, a fully afkable, safespottable monster, now drops a more valuable log loot (35 magic logs), than a high level, hard as nails bossmonster. My suggestion would have been replacing that particular drop with an alchable of about 30-40k. Still a significant nerf, but a more logical one.

Instead of removing other overpowered shit they've added to the range skill (d thrownaxe, rigor, blowpipe, ballista) they take out something that was already agreed upon, and did it with no poll.\n\nNot to mention the serp helm, why the fuck does it use scales if it doesn't venom? They could have sufficiently nerfed it by moving the str bonus to +3 or +4. Instead they eviscerated it and essentially relegated it to being 20k scales as it's only use.\n\nZulrah... this is like what the third time they've nerfed it?

I was there just over 2hrs and made 3.1m . That is stupidly strong for 0 thought. If they were going to nerf something like zulrah that does require some level of thought and gear, why leave things that are almost afkable to the extreme like Goyles, Nechs, Brutals and Shamans?\n\nI think you overestimate that the zulrah nerf will entice more people to go around the world mining and whatnot. There is too much dead content that the majority of the people happy to farm zulrah for hours on end, just wont be willing to do.\n\nYour point about karils : it is like 3m to buy, that takes 2-3hrs at brutal blacks. Void takes several hours at best. I understand it is a lower item level requirement but if they want to lower it by such a margin then reduce the cost of obtaining it.\n\nWhilst I agree that people are flaming rather than posting constructively, Asking them to say nothing and be quiet until the mods let us know their internal thinking, is rather silly.

The gear lacks accuracy, and scales off of your total accuracy, and gives a damage boost. So logically the higher your range is (because you get accuracy), and the better gear you have it scales based off of that. Void isnt bIS on any monsters pre 92 range, and it became bIS on certain bosses (raid, zulrah, kraken?).

They should have nerfed it for PvP alone, and left as is. Or they could have reduced it to 15%, and left Elite void at 20% damage. They could even increase the repair cost of void when dying to deter people from using it so much. I would be less likely to use if I had to drop 500k-1m gold per death on void.

Omit them from both sides of the Yes and No and we see that most community said yes, showing that it might be a problem. \n\nOther things can also affect this poll like other poll information/ content that shows high traffic of new players. They said things they nerfed were also because they had a difficult time adding new items since the current items/content were \"too much\" of an item to have their new stuff even compete. And let's say that new items/bosses bring in new people. So we nerf boss/items to make more suitable bosses/items in order to not destroy the use of other skills and then market while inherently bring in new players.\n\nLike they said in the update post, people on reddit just want to change things again and again and again to their own liking rather than building on top of it for the whole community."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e361c"},"author":"davidlee944","created":1.495711532e+09,"message":"Its jagex, they will bury their heads in the sand until the damage has already been done and they get enough complaints on reddit, ideally we need to complain about it as much as skillers did about zulrah"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e361e"},"author":"KehoAseena","created":1.495711079e+09,"message":"What does this have to do with Zulrah/Void nerf?"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e3624"},"author":"ZirGsuz","created":1.495710831e+09,"message":"Same reason they never polled Zulrah's drop table, they don't poll balance changes."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e365f"},"author":"IHateEveryone12211","created":1.495748284e+09,"message":"It also made elite void worthless even though it has a lot more reqs than arma including chompy kills, a zulrah kill, 75 thieving, multiple quests, 100 cmb, 70 mining, plus it takes like 10 hours to get. they should at least make elite void as good as it used to be.

You can also right-click the icon for a full screen option.\n\nThe resizeable, floating world map can be open as you play. You can even have other interfaces open alongside it.\n\n\n\nOnce open, the in-game world map has a number of useful functions.\n\nIf you wish to see a key, click the key button found in the bottom left of the interface.\n\n\n\nClicking on one of the items in the key will cause the icons on the map to briefly flash, allowing you to easily locate whatever it is you are looking for!\n\n\n\n\nIf you have the floating world map open, you can move it by clicking the border at the top and dragging.\n\nIf you wish to resize the window, click the border anywhere other than at the top of the world map window and drag to resize.\n\n\n\nIf you're struggling to find what you are looking for, you can try using the search function.

Luckily for you, the in-game world map also includes intra-map links!\n\n\n\nIf you are in a dungeon with a number of rooms or floors connected by different types of entrances, the world map will show you where those entrances will take you with intra-map links.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Balancing Changes**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nWhen it comes to our priorities for updates, the longevity of Old School is **alwys** at the top of the list. We want to ensure Old School is here for you to play and enjoy for years to come.\n\nThe community has always strongly leaned towards the idea of fixing existing problems rather than building on top of them. With this in mind, we sat down and took a critical look at some of the most problematic pieces of content in game.\n\nToday's update includes several unpolled balancing changes to existing pieces of content; changes we strongly believe to be in the best interest of Old School's long term health.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Zulrah Drop Table**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nZulrah has remained one of the most consistently profitable monsters in game since its release in early 2015. It has fundamentally changed how many people play Old School - providing unmatched rates of consistent profit.\n\nWhile we don't have an issue with a challenging piece of content being profitable, just how profitable that content may be is something we do need to consider - and we have concluded that Zulrah is too rewarding.\n\nAs it stands, many players see Zulrah as the only option for making money. It is so fast and so consistent that few other options seem worthwhile.\n\nTo address this, **we have now reduced the average value of loots from Zulrah by roughly 30%.** As a part of this change, we have also replaced some of Zulrah's resource drops with items which will have a less significant economic impact on skillers.\n\nThe specific changes made to the drop table are:\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n* The drop-rate of Magic tree seeds has been decreased.\n* The number of Runite ore dropped has been decreased from 10 to 2.\n* Mahogany planks have been replaced by Mahogany logs.\n* The number of Papaya seeds dropped has been increased from 2 to 3.\n* The number of Snapdragon seeds dropped has been decreased from 2 to 1.\n* The number of Torstol seeds dropped has been decreased from 2 to 1.\n* Raw sharks have been replaced by Cooked manta rays and the number dropped has been decreased from 100 to 35.\n* The number of Torstols dropped has been decreased from 20 to 10.\n* The number of Dwarf weeds dropped has been increased from 20 to 30.\n* The number of Toadflax dropped has been increased from 20 to 25.\n* The number of Snapdragons dropped has been decreased from 20 to 10.\n* Magic logs have been replaced by Yew logs and the number dropped has been decreased from 100 to 35.\n* The number of Dragon bones dropped has been decreased from 30 to 12.\n* The number of Coal dropped has been decreased from 300 to 200.\n* The number of Adamantite bars dropped has been decreased from 25 to 20.\n* Saradomin brews have been replaced by Bird's nests.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\n**Serpentine Helm**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nThe Serpentine Helm provides unmatched defensive and offensive stats and effects. It is a must-have for almost any combat activity in Old School.\n\nIts outstanding stats and venom/poison effects leave us very little room to introduce helmets of a similar tier. It is a near impossibility to design around the helmet in its current state without damaging the long term health of Old School.\n\nTo address this, we have now made a couple of changes to the Serpentine Helm. The helmet will no longer apply venom to enemies, and its strength bonus has been reduced from +5 to +3.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Void Knight Ranged Set**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nWhen we looked at the balance of Ranged equipment, the Void Knight set stood out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe set requires level 42 in combat stats and level 22 in Prayer to equip. It provides a 20% damage boost and 10% accuracy boost for Ranged combat. Aside from time invested, it is free to obtain.\n\nIn its current state it is simply overpowered. This set out-classes even the highest tier Ranged equipment in game in many scenarios - despite having substantially lower requirements.\n\nIts low requirements and low repair cost, combined with its overwhelming strength, completely wipes out any room for variety in PvP at many levels. There is simply no comparable alternative.\n\nTo address the above concerns, we have now lowered the damage bonus of the Void Knight Ranged set to 10%.\n\nThis change leaves the Void Knight Ranged set in a place where it is still strong at many levels, and it still has a place as an alternative to higher cost equipment.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Dropping in the Wilderness**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nRisk is something which comes hand-in-hand with the Wilderness. It is a dangerous, abandoned land where its inhabitants do as they please. The way that dropping items in the Wilderness currently works doesn't always play into this vision.\n\nTo address this, tradeable items dropped manually from your inventory within the Wilderness will now appear instantly to all players.\n\nThis change will prevent players in the Wilderness dropping items just before they die in order to run back and pick them up. Be cautious with what you bring to the Wilderness - and consider the risk before you take anything of value!\n\nIn addition to this change, food and potions dropped within the Wilderness will now never appear for other players. This change does not affect the loot you receive from other players.\n\nPreventing the exchanging of food and potions mid-combat stops teams from providing their team mates with an unlimited flow of supplies - negating any real risk in single-way combat areas.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Karamja General Store**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nThe Karamja General Store has long been a controversial part of Old School. The negativity it creates in the community certainly outweighs the benefits it provides as a piece of content.\n\nAs such, we have reduced the effect of the Karamja hard diary reward which changes the price of items sold to the store. Items sold there will now be worth less than their high alchemy value.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Tournament World - Fight Caves**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nIn preparation for the release of the Inferno next week, we have opened up two tournament worlds in which you can access the Fight Caves!\n\nHead over to world 401 or 407, grab your dream set up and get practicing! You can access the Fight Cave using the portal located near the bank chest.\n\nAnd, of course, you can take advantage of the maxed stats and unlimited free gear in Clan Wars, too!\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n* Fixed a typo with Ali the Mayor.\n* Fixed a typo with the Scorpion Catcher quest.\n* Fixed a typo with Gunnjorn’s examine.\n* Fixed a typo with the Temple of Ikov quest.\n* Fixed 2 typos with the Eadger’s Ruse quest.\n* Clue scrolls requiring you to teleport with a personal spirit tree now works with your POH planted spirit tree.\n* Players can now charge their imbued Skull Sceptre with the bottom half.\n* Fixed a typo with Lilly in the Warrior’s Guild.\n* Fixed an examine typo with a piano.\n* Fixed a typo in the Slayer tower basement.\n* Players will no longer get multiple clueless scrolls if they have it stored in their POH.\n* Fixed a typo with the Elite Void Knight.\n* Moved baby black dragons closer together for convenience in Taverley dungeon.\n* Players may no longer deposit a looting bag into a bank on DMM while there’s loot inside.\n* Added the correct link to the Summer Special information page on the bonds interface.\n* Hickton now only has one cape.\n* The unpowered orb seen in the charging animation has been updated to the correct colours.\n* Removed a push tile."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e3c09"},"author":"Lofty---","created":1.495720334e+09,"message":"Zulrah should have same drops as black demons, and just give bonus xp for a kill "},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e3c0a"},"author":"holydeltawings","created":1.495720733e+09,"message":"This is not the PC update we had a poll on a month ago. \n\nZulrah is fine being nerfed but stop bringing in new items that are way OP than handicapping old content because it boosts the new stuff too high.  \n\nAt this point should just buff the shit out of pc with way higher points and easier rounds.

First they try to nerf it by removing the tele scrolls and when that fails they nerf the phases and randomize rotations and when that fails, they nerf Zulrah drops completely.

Make a very unique and one of a kind item obsolete.\n\nI'm fully expecting all these people praising Jagex for taking a stand to protect the future of the game to get home from work/school today and go chop a 100 magic logs or mine 300 coal unil they realize how stupis they are. Unless you're f2p, a brand new player looking to make your first 100k or someone tripping on shrooms, skilling can never truly be a viable money maker  until higher levels. \n\nThey haven't benefited the game's economy or future in any way beyond simply making some 99s *slightly* more/less profitable.

It provides +4 STR and defence bonuses comparable to its more defencive counterparts. It is very expensive and requires 65 Defence. The second best is debatable between Torag's Chest and the Fighter's Torso. The Torso has the STR bonus of Bandos, but at a low defence. Torag's requires 70 Defence and provides 20% Better defence stats than Bandos, but none of the str. You should have both and switch depending on the activity.\n\nFor the pants slot, Bandos Tassets are the best. They provide fairly hefty STR and Defence bonus. Second best is Torag's Platelegs, the highest defence legging in game.\n\nBiS boots are the Primordial boots. They only provide slight bonuses over Dragon Boots and should not be used until you have higher priority gear sorted out. They are made with Dragon Boots and provide +5 STR, versus DBoot's +4.\n\nBiS Gloves (For ALL situations, not just melee) are Barrows Gloves. They require full completion of RFD to obtain. The othet BiS gloves come from RFD as well, down as far as Mithril, which are equal to the Combat Bracelet. Addy gloves are equal to the regen bracelet, and Rune Gloves are the second best Melee gloves.\n\nBiS ring is the imbued Berserker Ring, followed by a regular Berserker Ring, followed by a Warrior Ring. Research into the 'Nightmare Zone' minigame and the imbues that result is highly reccomended.\n\nBiS Ammo for Melee is a Blessing. The Peaceful is cheap at less than 10k gold and provides the same benefit as them all, +1 Prayer.\n\nThe BiS Cape is the Fire Cape, obtained from Jad, followed by a Skillcape, followed by an Obsidian cape. Manual research into all of these and how to obtain onebis reccomended.\n\nThe Fire Cape will be replacedvas BiS on June first, when the new boss, The Inferno, is released as a succesor to fight caves.\n\nThe best Amulet is a Torture, followed a Fury, followed by a Glory. Unless you have plenty of money to spend, using a Glory is reccomended, as it is only slightly worse than a Fury at less than 0.75% of the price.\n\nThat should be everything you need to know.\n\nEDIT: As of today's update, the Serpentine Helm is not worth your money. Stick to the Helm of Neitiznot."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e40dd"},"author":"threw_it_up","created":1.495750535e+09,"message":"If the changes stay the way they are, then I suspect they will go up, but only a little, and slowly. \n\nLess scales will be entering the game because fewer people will be grinding Zulrah, but at the same time less are being used because the serp helm is no longer as good.

The efficient version would be to 2t teak logs for very fast wc xp to 99, then fletch darts for unbelievably fast fletching xp to 99, then do Zulrah to make money in the hundreds of hours that you'd save for a net profit of a few hundred million in the same amount of time.

Better dps.  Use mage's book instead.  Defense is not a factor when fighting zulrah.  The only damage you take is from mage form's range attacks.  \n\nReally, the biggest factor is just learning the rotations.  Once you know what to expect next, you know exactly where you're supposed to stand, you know how many hits you can get in.  \n\nI honestly skimmed your video, but some small things: You were praying range for the first form.  I'm not sure if this was your first run through, but this form literally does nothing but spawn venom clouds.  You don't need prayer.  That's obviously really small, not a big deal, but if you waste enough prayer points to the point where you need to take a sip, then it could affect your kill time.\n\nNext, the biggest problem.  You wasted an entire form at around 2:00.  The melee form.  You stood where you're supposed to.  He can't hit you with his windup attack at that position at all, but you weren't attacking him.  I was kind of confused by that.  \n\nThat's about all I watched, but the biggest advice anyone can give you is to just keep killing zulrah until you get a feel for the rotations and then you'll know exactly what's coming next, what gear you need, what prayer you need, where you need to stand, and how many hits you can get in.  That's what makes the absolute biggest difference. \n\nEdit: Also, venge if you can.  Venge is the most useful during the mage form.  It's best to venge exactly when you see a ranged attack, otherwise you're very likely to waste it on a snakeling attack, which dies instantly to recoil.  \n\nAlso, it was really obnoxious to tell if you're even wearing a recoil ring because of how much you spam your f keys.  I didn't see a second recoil in your ring and I thought I saw you killing snakelings at some point.  Bring a ring of suffering ideally, but if not, bring a recoil.

In doing so, it puts the game in very scary point where the only way forward is to continuously create better gear with better stats for better content otherwise, the community, by then, would have the BiS gear and makes any attempt at mid tier content useless. [This image sums up Power creep in a nutshell](http://imgur.com/a/cE2uH)\n\nLook at Zulrah, BiS used to be ACB in most range situation but now people would rather use the Blowpipe over ACB in 90% of any situation. Additions to OSRS needs to be niche. Look at Dragonhunter Crossbow, its a strong crossbow but only against Dragons, a nice niche addition. \n\nNew content needs to fill some niche roles in the game unlike how Soul Split is overall a literal upgrade to any prayer you need in OSRS. Even if people were to grind out 99 Prayer, it would still be the BiS prayer that everyone would recommend over anything else.\n\nCurrently, Barrows and GWD armor go hand in hand in terms of bonuses.

Once you get in the late stages web app you should add a sidebar up and down the page that shows daily records, i.e. Most coins, most herbs, how many godsword hilts, how many pet drops, just so other users can see all the cool stuff that's happening. \n\n\nOne problem with this would be people manipulating numbers so you'd have to have a profile that say someone gets a pet, clicking pet on that profile again is disabled. Also you'd probably want to find out the fastest kill times on bigger monsters so you can put a timer that restricts loot input, so that people can't spam items to get the top listing lol.\n\n\nAnother thing you could add which I think would be amazing, but it would have to follow the previously stated restrictions. Is show the current rate/drop rate of items people are getting. For example:\n\n\nTorstol herbs per hour: 100\n\nCurrent drop rate (supply/kill count): 1/32\n\n\nAlso you can make a background mini list where every loot log that gets put in tracks a kill, that way you can see how many kills of everything is going on, like if 700 goblins were killed that day. 2500 Abbies killed that day, 10,000 zulrahs etc etc.\n\nAnyway, data is awesome, people love it, which is why crystal math labs is doing so well. If you develop something really nice and amazing, I could see crystal math labs wanting to purchase it from you and putting it on their site (idk if they have the resources for that, it could just be a kid who owns it) or you eventually getting enough popularity that putting ads on the site will generate you a little side money.\n\nSo good luck with everything!

An hour at a minimum wage job will pay for a month of membership, as opposed to spending all your hard earned gp just to login. For me it helps me relax, enjoy the game and I can spend the money I earn on whatever I feel like. Once you get your skills or combat up, it becomes much much easier to make bond money as you'll be making a lot more money from skills or high level slayer monsters or bosses (something like double natures or Zulrah, which can net you easily 1.5m+/hr). They are also doing the summer special right now, where you buy 2 months of membership and receive 3 months. \n\nSo, sorry for the long rant which didn't answer your question! If you really want to make money skilling, I suggest you check out these spreadsheets: [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/edit#gid=1432395404) \n\nThose are calculators for almost every skill or activity in the game. You really want to train as gp efficiently as possible, especially when paying with bonds. For easy skills to get into, I would suggest fletching or cooking. \n\nFor cooking, you'll have to spend a little money to get to the point where you start making some (probably around 70 for monkfish, then sharks at 80) and you ABSOLUTELY have to get the cooking gauntlets from the Family Crest quest. These reduce your burn rate significantly. I also suggest doing the Hosidius house favor on Zeah (new continent) which gives you access to a stove with lower burn rate (stacks with gauntlets). With both gauntlets and stove, you'll burn only about ~6% of your sharks at level 80 and that rate drops as you level up. This will get you about 150k/hr at level 80 up to about 200k/hr when you stop burning. Cooking is also extremely AFK so you can train another account, study, watch netflix or whatever else you want to do.\n\nFor fletching, if you want to make money, buy the bowstrings and unstrung bows (i.e. yew longbow (u) ), string them and sell em. Stringing only is wayyy more money then cutting the logs yourself, as you'll see in those spreadsheets I linked. It is also much fast xp, however it is considerably less AFK then cutting bows is. The best path for fletching would be to get level 50, then string maple shorts, string maple longs, skip yew shorts, then string yew longs. When you make it to yew longs, you'll be making about 380k/hr with 180k xp/hr which is damn good for a low level account.\n\nI realize that this response is getting absurdly long, but you asked a complex question :) Feel free to ask me any questions or add me in game!

The obvious one is the existence of higher tier food that already exists - there's no reason sharks should ever be worth more than Anglerfish or Dark Crabs, so sharks ever reaching 2,000 each is already out of the question. The lesser addressed factor suppressing the value of sharks, specifically the raw sharks zulrah drops, is that most people have shifted to making wine for bulk cooking xp because of how much faster it is at relatively minimal cost. So while everybody needs cooked sharks, not many people need raw sharks, and as such their price lags further and further behind the cooked version. \n\n\n\nThat went on longer than I expected, but yeah just some general thoughts I have on the well-worn \"zulrah ruined skilling\" topic.

They should be working to make those skills viable again, not putting a bandiad over the issue. Part of the growing gap between skilling and pvm as far as gp/hr is the fact that skilling resources are given to pvm. If you lower it, not even take it away, like if zulrah is now only 10-20 noted sharks per drop it it would raise the price of sharks making skilling more profitable while lowering the profitability of something like zulrah.\n\nA major issue right now is that the community is under the impression that every new release needs to be better or comparable gold/hr compared to everything else. Why does bossing have to be consistently profitable? IMO it should be more or less break even unless you get a big drop. There's no reason to have these mobs be consistent money makers through common and uncommon drops (that are ultimately devaluing skills). It should be entirely possibly for you do grind out a boss for 1-2 hours and break even - conversely it should also be possible for you to make a few million in that couple hours.\n"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e6839"},"author":"Statue_left","created":1.49549101e+09,"message":"Wc bots are non existent but zulrah bots are ruining the game\n\nEl oh el\n\n"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297e683b"},"author":"Starbreezes","created":1.495483566e+09,"message":"I wasn't talking about bots though, bots are entirely time irrelevant.

As it stands, everyone just skips a lot of tasks because there isn't much else to do with points anyways... When you get a boss task, maybe the master could start by asking \"would you like to pick which boss for 100 points?\", and then after either picking or getting a random amount, you would get another choice \"pick 1-35 kills for free, and 5 slayer points for every additional kill; max 100 kills\".\n\nFor example, this would mean that when you roll \"boss task\", you could pick General Graardor for 100 points, and then pick 100 kills for 325 more points, or 425 points for your specific choice and maximum amount.\n\nI would suggest doubling the points to pick zulrah, and doubling the points per kill over 35, meaning 950 points to get a zulrah task of 100, to avoid abusing this.\n\nThere could also be something along the lines of not being allowed to pick the same boss twice in a row, or having to pay extra to do so.

You can kill Corp in a one to a few clicks and majority of people will kill every GWD boss on their first try. Yet there are many people who require numerous attempts for their first Zulrah kill.\n\nZulrah is one of the most killed bosses mainly due to it being a solo boss and how convenient it is. You don't have to wait for teammates nor get KC, you can get to the boss in a matter of seconds, and there's no waiting for it to respawn. Note that none of these are factors that determine a bosses difficulty.\n\n90% of the player base? Made up statistics, but I'll bite. If 90% of players usually grind Zulrah, explain why 90% of players aren't usually in decent gear with a decent mage and range level.\n\nAccess to a boss isn't relevant to its difficulty. 100% of players have access to Corp, but this has no relation to how hard it is.\n\nThe mechanical difficulty comes from having accurate clicks and timing. How difficult is this aspect? It's relative. Some people can reliably do multiple switches while managing prayer, health and position. Some people can't and do the minimum, but get less kph as a result. Refer to hybrid pk videos or speed Zulrah kills if you believe there's absolutely no mechanical difficulty involved. \n\nGood luck getting a terrible PVMer to go from zero to a Zulrah \"master\" in 20 hours of practice.\n\nAnything in this game is bottable. Bots are programmed to complete a task without human error (ideally) using previous knowledge of how to do said task. There are calculators that can solve complex integrals in a second. Does this mean solving the integral by hand is easy? Also, yes it's just 4-8 gear switches, prayer switches, and repositioning for every phase change. Compared to GWD bosses and Corp, this is significantly more input.\n\nThere are hundreds of guides for every boss, what's your point? And of course Jad is harder than Zulrah's Jad phase. Most would expect an entire boss fight after 62 waves to be more difficult than a single phase at Zulrah.\n\nI never mentioned myself in my previous comment.

I'll look into adding Zulrah this weekend. You're right, tons of people kill Zulrah so that would be popular. It won't be quite as easy as just adding a Zulrah text drop table like other monsters because Zulrah drops two items each kill and also drops scales 100% but in varying amounts. This means you would want to track the exact 100% scale drop each kill (instead of just assuming kills = bones like with dragons or something). Also, my program assumes that each drop equals a kill so if you clicked the two drops it would count twice upwards which gets your kill count off. I guess I could have it check if the monster selected is Zulrah and if so, count kills differently. Or maybe it would be better to have a whole separate tab for bosses since a lot of them have unique loot mechanics unlike normal mobs. Like Barrows chests and shit. I'll look into it, thanks for the feedback though man! It's been hard to get peoples opinions on it just by describing it. I'm going to look into providing it as a web page service instead of an exe this weekend, because there's a lot of downsides to having it be a standalone program.

Removing magic logs from Zulrah's drop table isn't going to suddenly revitalize Woodcutting because Woodcutting magic logs is the worst way to train the skill period. Same goes for sharks - they're trash xp and not even 100k gp/hr, removing them from zulrah won't suddenly make Fishing a viable way to make money. \n\n\n**Here's my actually unpopular opinion:** Resources like sharks and magic logs were added to PVM drop tables because they are some of the highest demand resources in the game, but the traditional methods of acquiring them are so outdated that they are no longer able to keep up with demand. The OSRS economy is dominated by consumers, not gatherers, and without PVM as a supplemental (or for something like sharks primary) source of these resources then there would be nowhere near enough supply in game for modern players."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297eac80"},"author":"roxo9","created":1.495043049e+09,"message":"The only thing that would upset the balance of the game would be removing things from zulrahs table.

Even at their absolute highest price points (which both happened after Zulrah was released but that's for a topic for another thread) these resources were still never worth gathering. You cut/fish roughly 80-100 magic logs/sharks an hour - that is truly abysmal, and is so out of date with the pace of OSRS that these skilling methods are unsalvageable in their current state.

That's an undeniable truth and if you're arguing against that, you're arguing against 200+ years of capitalist economics. \n\nWhat i THINK/hope you're saying is that because prices will rise due to lower supply, demand will fall.\n\nWhich is true. That will happen. However, you're wrong on two parts.\n\n1. \"But a small portion of all higher tier food comes from PvM\" That's simply not the case. The only other noted high tier food dropped in PVM is Anglers, at a rate of 60, from Skotozio, aka one of the least killed bosses in the game. I think Monkfish are dropped noted too, but only by one boss and i can't remember which one.\n\n2. \"Some people will switch over to monkfish, dark crabs, tuna potatoes, anglerfish, karambwans, brews, etc.\" This is true, but that doesn't mean demand for sharks will vanish. There will still be a market for them. With 60-90% of their current supply income gone, prices will go up until they're at a point where both people who catch them and people who buy them are satisfied. That's called the invisible hand of the market. You also fail to realize that the price of all food would go up because like you said, demand for them would rise as people switch from sharks to them. So eventually there would be less incentive for people to switch off of sharks, because the market would stabilize though at a higher price than currently.\n\nSo yes, fishing as a whole would be marginally more profitable, but sharks in specific would be significantly more profitable.\n\nWhile I agree sharks are never going to reach the profitability of zulrah, not everyone plays with the same goals, skill, or interests. Not everyone 3 tick mines granite and tick manipulates fishing and wood cutting for max efficiency.\n\nIn any case, there is NOTHING which sets the price of items in stone in osrs besides alching. Prices are dominated entirely by supply and demand.\n\nThats why the best anti poison is the cheapest, and relatively useless armor, 3rd age, is the most expensive.\n\nThe only other factors are things small influences like indicators of wealth (Phats, Tbow, Ely Shield), market manipulation (Flipping), and other relatively weak influences."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297ebb1a"},"author":"ArcDriveFinish","created":1.494976204e+09,"message":"You need a minimum of a couple of mil cash stack to do blast furnace.

Just look at the antivenom dropped by zulrah, should be the most expensive because it's the best, but its actually the cheapest. Or look at 3rd age equipment for the opposite example, completely useless practically, but worth a fortune because of it's low supply.\n\nYou're right that no one would buy a shark if it was the same price as an angler, but if it was like a 100-200 difference?

Some like Pure Essence were intentionally devalued to hurt bots and the OSRS Team told us that. Others like Logs and Ores aren't as big of a deal since most are tied heavily to alch prices and independent since each are used at different level ranges, unlike Fish.

Could it be getting to the point where PvM is so lucrative that skilling is basically invalidated? I mean double nats is like 1m/h? Zulrah doubles that and all it requires is medium-high combat skills. As someone returning to RS I don't see much point the massive grindy investment of getting 92+ RC when you can simply get good combat stats (something most players will aim for anyway) and get twice as much cash. On top of that getting good combat stats will always be a safer investment because there will always be more new pvm stuff with extremely high rewards, whilst with skilling your MM methods will slowly decline as more people acquire the skills. \n\nRight now starting again basically from scratch top priority seems to be getting high enough combat skills to take advantage of these opportunities, with a few supporting skills alongside. RC, blast furnace smithing, pretty much any other lucrative 'skilling' seems secondary and most skills just seem like something you spend gp and time on for the sake of e-peen."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297ed478"},"author":"BioMasterZap","created":1.494899165e+09,"message":"Funny you mentioned hides because Zulrah did drop those but it was removed due to complaints.

But there is nothing wrong with dropping some of those items as long as the quantity is low enough that PvM doesn't provide most the supply.\n\nSide note: it does seem a bit bias to say it is okay for PvM to drop Gems, or even herbs and seeds in too large of quantities, since those are resources from skilling; Gem Mining, Farming, and Thieving respectively. It is probably easier to accept because those resources have always been more common from PvM in the past, but so have Logs, Ores, and Bars if you pay attention; just some newer bosses took it to more extremes."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297ed47b"},"author":"BioMasterZap","created":1.494856136e+09,"message":"Not at all.

Not as sure for Thieving, but it does have some good methods like Master Farmers with Rogue.\n\nJust because Skilling methods don't rival bosses like Zulrah doesn't mean they are dead. Back in the day, I did more PvM but these days I prefer to skill. It is less profit, but it is also less effort for the most part; even Runecrafting is easier than bossing. A lot of players watch a streamer kill Zulrah and go \"lol, its soo easy\" but in reality, it really isn't that easy; they are just used to it and that is the type of content they are comfortable with.\n\nAlso, claiming they can never \"save\" the other skills is ridiculous. Zulrah might drop Magic Logs, but that only affects Magic Logs. If Woodcutting did see a new high-level tree with a demand for its resource, unlike Redwoods, it could profit without being impacted by PvM unless the resource was later added to PvM too.

The whole \"intended method\" thing is kinda exaggerated as it often doesn't have a significant impact on the skill or was never intended to be exclusive to the skill.\n\nFor example, before Runecrafting was added, Runes only came from Shops and Monster Drops. Runecrafting was added to provide an additional source, not to be the only source. And Runecrafting is highly profitable, with up to 1-2m profit per hour. Other skills like Mining and Smithing can also yield high profit, sometimes over 1m. While Ores and Bars are dropped through PvM, most of them were already at or close to alch prices so it didn't greatly devalue them.\n\nNow I do agree that it is not good when you can get resources faster through PvM than through skilling; e.g. kill Zulrah for Sharks faster than you can Fish them. But to expect that all skilling resources come purely from Skilling seems a bit too far since Monsters and Bosses have often had skilling resource drops in small quantities and it never posed much of an issue; the problem is when they are in large quantities."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297ed486"},"author":"NullPlayerID","created":1.49480556e+09,"message":"Not to helpful when people bot bosses such as zulrah and still aquire mass amounts of resources."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297ed4b2"},"author":"Cool-Miner","created":1.494861191e+09,"message":"First of all, smithing, specifically smelting at blast furnace, is a processing skill, in a completely different situation than gathering skills. The only real reason blast furnace can be profitable is because of the high demand for the product: high level skillers want to make rune items, everyone wants cannonballs.\n\nMining is different, in that there are numerous pvm bosses that provide more ores/hr than the most popular methods to mine them. The only exception is blast mine, which is locked behind favor, requires the investment of dynamite, is click intensive and dangerous if you mess up.\n\nFishing has an equivalent: dark crabs.

It used to be **500%** that price! Obviously this means we need to remove flax drops from Zulrah and NMZ and wherever else and make the Flax fields the EXCLUSIVE way to gather this item, because this should be a legitimate money making method even though it'd cause a massive market shift in significant favour of the bots who make up the significant portion of people who pick flax and do other extremely AFK activities. Sure, many players would return to picking flax for 100-200k an hour or whatever it'd be. But so would an exponentially equal amount of bots. And now, instead of picking flax for a 2.5m whip, they're paying 8m or 10m. And I'm sure you're saying \"but now those people who killed abby demons are making significantly more!\", well, not quite. Now that person who sells that whip, who wants to upgrade their prayer is paying 7k for a single dragon bone. The money has shifted to the botters and the gold buyers hands rather than yours.

Now that we \"\"\"\"FIXED\"\"\"\" everything, it's ~10-15. \n\nUnfortunately to protect legitimate players the game *must* be catered towards bots in some aspects.

Obviously, you don't need the super defence if you are using protection prayers.\n\n4) don't be afraid to use protection prayers. Some tasks just deal too much damage to be practical with food or guthans.

(Dragon bones vs Whips, zulrah vs corporeal beast).\n\nI also like abby demon's only dropping whips while on task, and think more slayer monsters with unique drops should work that way, as unique drops should be more of a bonus of slayer monsters than \"something that is farmable\".\n\nIn that scenario it wouldn't matter if gp/hr isn't properly scaled, as it's only a bonus to getting the monsters as a task anyway, meaning they aren't \"farmable\".\n\nNow, I don't know how sustainable gargoyle/dark beast drop tables are, but for monsters that rely on rare drops for their drop tables, I don't consider those to be what you'd call \"farmable\".\n\nIt's a bit of a stretch of semantic wording, but what I mean is that I draw a distinction between something that commonly drops lots of herbs or runite items every other kill, versus something that drops a 3m item with a 1/1000 chance or something. You can't \"farm corporeal beast for guaranteed drops in the short term over a period of time\".\n\nGetting slayer exp and levels is a reward on its own. Because you get access to some of those unique drops.\n\n----\n\nPersonally, I also think that dark bow only really has value as a PvP spec weapon, which isn't saying much for dark bow. With more ranged specs out there, it makes sense that it'd lose intrinsic value. I can't see myself buying a dark bow for the spec, as I don't do a lot of ranged pking, and only do ranged in pvp minigames. Where melee specs would then be competing as the 'goto spec'.\n\nI mean, I guess giving it a sink would bloat the price, but you aren't making the weapon itself any more \"desireable\" as a playable item. It merely becomes a middleman for something else.\n\nIf you can find a better way to make dark bow desirable, then I'm all for it. But if all you're looking for is to increase arbitrary GP farming methods, I don't agree with your goals at all. Farm Zulrah instead, and if you think his drop table is unbalanced, ~~then fight for a change to that first~~ nah it's okay to tackle multiple things at once."},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297eec09"},"author":"K8K8K","created":1.494680825e+09,"message":"Never had any ahrim drops from zulrah :("},{"_id":{"$oid":"59f2fdaff5b73bcf297eec0c"},"author":"XcrystaliteX","created":1.494707852e+09,"message":"Thing with Zulrah is once you've done it once you just realize how easy it is.

Slayer changes up the grind a bit and the different monsters keep it challenging and entertaining.\n\n2) Others like to train on sandcrabs until level 70 in their desired stats and then afk NMZ their way to 99. Some people find it kind of boring and monotonous, supplies for runes/chins/zulrah scales/darts can be a bit costly. I figure players just watch netflix, play another game, or do something else while they afk.\n\nMost players just do a mix of both honestly.

Regardless, the reason why your times are so bad is most likely because you're missing attack tics by either not eating correctly, positioning correctly, swapping fast enough, or attacking correctly. You'll definitely fix this in time as you get better at killing him, so just keep on fighting him and you'll get the timer down. One thing I can think of would be don't spend time while zulrah is attackable by eating unless absolutely necessary.
